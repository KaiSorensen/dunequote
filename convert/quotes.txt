	- Neils Bohr

The line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.
	- Friedrich Nietzsche

The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: ‘I feed on your energy.’
	- Dune: Messiah

Even though you broke my heart yet again, in another life I would’ve really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you. I’m not kind because I’m naive; I’m kind because it’s strategic and necessary.

Every civilization must contend with an unconscious force which can block, betray or countermand almost any conscious intention of the collectivity.
	- Tleilaxu Theorem

No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/ human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.

Most men live lives of quiet desperation.

In the modern world, as competitive as it is, all those 18 year old girls you went to school with are talking to some 28-year-old man with a yacht somehow, and you’re sitting there lonely and you don’t have motivation? You must be out of your mind. The only way to win this game is to become as powerful as possible.

	- Ghadhean al-Fali from Children of Dune

Old father eternity always waits patiently.
	- Leto II from Children of Dune

Are you God, Namri, that you invoke absolutes? Every judgment teeters on the brink of error. To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous. Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.
	- Leto II from Children of Dune

We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.
	- Charles Bukowski

I stand in the sacred human presence. As I do now, so should you stand someday. I pray to your presence that this be so. The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas. We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create.
	- Children of Dune

Church and State, scientific reason and faith, the individual and his community, even progress and tradition — all of these can be reconciled in the teachings of Muad'Dib. He taught us that there exist no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men. Anyone can rip aside the veil of Time. You can discover the future in the past or in your own imagination. Doing this, you win back your consciousness in your inner being. You know then that the universe is a coherent whole and you are indivisible from it.

The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience—a process that cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process.

True humility and FEAR of the Lord lead to riches, honor, and long life.

The traditions of dead generations weigh like a nightmare on the minds of the living.
	- Carl Marx

You Bene Gesserit call your activity of the Panoplia Prophetica a "Science of Religion." Very well. I, a seeker after another kind of scientist, find this an appropriate definition. You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies. You I must warn, however. You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved. Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of [away from] life. It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite.
	- The Preacher from Children of Dune

Sometimes I would like to ask God why He allows poverty, suffering, and injustice when He could do something about it. But I’m afraid He would ask me the same question.

It is not death that a man should fear, but rather he should fear never beginning to live.

It is our attitude toward events, not events themselves, which we can control. Nothing is by its own nature calamitous—even death is terrible only if we fear it.

Good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.
	- Donald Trump

We perhaps cannot have many points in common, only, you know, I personally don't believe in that last notion, because it often only seems that there are no points in common, when there really are a lot ... it comes from people's laziness, that they sort themselves out by looks and can't find anything.

Even for extraordinarily lucky people, life is difficult. And when we look at what makes it difficult, we see that we are all prisoners of our thoughts.

America represents something universal in the human spirit. I received a letter not long ago from a man who said, 'You can go to Japan to live, but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey, and you won't become a German or a Turk.' But then he added, 'Anybody from any corner of the world can come to America to live and become an American.
	- Ronald Reagan

The best way to serve the audience is to ignore them.
	- Rick Rubin

Reading after a certain age diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, just as the man who spends too much time in the theater is tempted to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.
	- Albert Einstein

If you love your life more than me, you cannot be my disciple.

Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right.

	- ‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬ ‭ESV‬‬

Tao is not a name for a thing, but the underlying natural order of the universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe because it is non-conceptual yet evident in one's being of aliveness. The Tao is "eternally nameless" and should be distinguished from the countless named things that are considered to be its manifestations, the reality of life before its descriptions of it.
	- Lao Tzu
	
The same spiritual fulfillment people find in religion can be found in science, by coming to know the mind of God.
	- Carolyn Porco

[Tao] means a road, path, way; and hence, the way in which one does something; method, doctrine, principle. The Way of Heaven, for example, is ruthless; when autumn comes 'no leaf is spared because of its beauty, no flower because of its fragrance'. The Way of Man means, among other things, procreation; and eunuchs are said to be 'far from the Way of Man'. Chu Tao is 'the way to be a monarch', i.e. the art of ruling. Each school of philosophy has its Tao, its doctrine of the way in which life should be ordered. Finally in a particular school of philosophy whose followers came to be called Taoists, Tao meant 'the way the universe works'; and ultimately something very like God, in the more abstract and philosophical sense of that term.

Your worst sin is that you betrayed yourself for nothing.
	- Dostoevsky

Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of.
	- The Great Divorce

For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.

Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
