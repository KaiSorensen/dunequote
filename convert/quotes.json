Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: ‘I feed on your energy.’",

Doing this, you win back your consciousness in your inner being. You know then that the universe is a coherent whole and you are indivisible from it.",
